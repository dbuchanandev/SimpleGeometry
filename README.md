# SimpleGeometry

## Description
I wanted an easier way to access SF Symbols in my projects. This has some added organization and a few convenience features.
My goal is to make this easier to maintain as Apple updates their available SF Symbols.
Also, if anyone at Apple happens to come across this, I would love to kill this project. ðŸ˜œ
All SFSymbols and Categories are listed here in the order in which they are presented in the macOS SF Symbols app Version 1.1 (16).
All enums in this package conform to `CaseIterable` and `Identifiable`. You won't need to provide your own `id:` when used with `ForEach` in SwiftUI.

## Usage
#### Symbol String ID
```swift
import SwiftUI
import SFSymbolsPackage

struct ExampleSwiftUIView: View {

let symbol: String

var body: some View {

// Provided inits accept String or any type conforming to SFSymbol protocol
Image(symbol: symbol)
.resizable()
.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
.padding()
}

}
```

#### Generic usage
If you're not using mixed categorized symbols, it may be easier use generic types that conform to the `SFSymbol` protocol.
Even though they have the same RawValue type, mixing symbol categories will not compile the way this is written currently. If you know how to fix this, let me know.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import SFSymbolsPackage

struct ExampleSwiftUIView<S:SFSymbol>: View {

let symbol: S

var body: some View {

// Provided inits accept String or any type conforming to SFSymbol protocol
Image(symbol: symbol)
.resizable()
.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
.padding()
}

}
```

#### Initialization
```swift
// SwiftUI Image
let image = Image(symbol: SFSymbols._00Circle)
// or
let image = Image(symbol: SFSymbols._00Circle.id)
```
```swift
// SwiftUI Label - available on iOS 14+, OSX 11+, watchOS 7+, tvOS 14+
let label = Label("Title String", symbol: SFSymbols._00Circle)
// or
let label = Label("Title String", symbol: SFSymbols._00Circle.id)
```
```swift
// UIImage
let image = UIImage(symbol: SFSymbols._00Circle)
// or
let image = UIImage(symbol: SFSymbols._00Circle.id)
```

SFSymbols.Weather
SFSymbols.ObjectsAndTools
